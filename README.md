# Batch Prefab Creation
### Description
Batch Prefab Creation is a Godot plugin to help batch creations of prefabs based on 3d models.

### Motivation
Moving from Unity, the process of recreate prefabs was heavily time consuming so, at first I tryed plugins but where not updated and I didn't liked the way the prefabs were created.
What I did different here? I used the native FBX support and created inherited scenes from the models so, any change on the source file re importing it will be translated to the fcreated prefab.


### Godot Version Support
The plugin was tested on Godot 4.3 and 4.4.1


### How it works?
Once enabled the plugin you will found a new tab:
